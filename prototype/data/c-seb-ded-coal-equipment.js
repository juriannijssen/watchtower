This one does not.\n\nIt also covers both coal types, where the bullet above it covers thermal only — so metallurgical coal equipment is caught even though metallurgical coal companies are not restricted as clients beyond the 5% mining test.\n\nCredit where it is due: this is a gap that had to be noticed before it could be closed."
